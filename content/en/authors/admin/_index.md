I graduated with a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Ochanomizu University in 2025.
I have been working as a Researcher in the Matsuo-Iwasawa Laboratory at the University of Tokyo.

My research focuses on understanding the world using machine learning and deep learning to help humans recognize objects and make predictions.
